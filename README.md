# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I create this project with Vite, is my first time use Vite and React in Git Hub

First I create the project in my laptop use
- With the next steps:
- npm create vite@latest
and the next step you are write the project name:
- ? project name:
- ? package name:
Is the same name
- npm install
Finally 
- npm run dev

Second
- we look from the source all folders and check the file git
  if it does not exist, it's ok

The next step is 
- create the repository in GitHub and keep the same name that local 
  and continue with the steps what show GitHub: example start with 
  the command git init after add the file readme.md, etc

- I detent because I feel what I need practice more, because the course isn't good, for be basic couse, so I create other file for the tests where I practice the basic concepts, how to use the hooks (useState)
